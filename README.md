# Retail Customer Analytics & Churn Prediction ðŸ“ˆ

This is a complete, end-to-end data analytics project developed as part of my 4th-year studies. The application analyzes transactional data from an online retailer to segment customers using RFM analysis and predicts customer churn with a machine learning model. The entire project is presented in a live, interactive Streamlit dashboard.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- Interactive UI: Built with Streamlit for a user-friendly experience.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In-depth analysis of sales, products, and customer behavior in the Jupyter Notebook.
- **RFM Customer Segmentation:** Customers are dynamically segmented into groups like "Best Customers," "Loyal," and "At Risk" based on their purchasing patterns.
- **Machine Learning Model:** A Random Forest Classifier trained to predict churn.
- **Critical Analysis:** Identified and explained the concept of data leakage, which led to the model's 100% accuracy on this dataset.
- **Interactive Prediction:** Allows users to input hypothetical customer data via sliders and get a real-time churn prediction.
- **Data Visualization:** Includes multiple interactive charts (pie charts, bar charts, scatter plots) built with Plotly to visualize customer segments and revenue.
